# Stock-Analysis:
# Project:  Develop stock analysis for Client Steve.
## 1st commit uploaded green_stocks-Module 2 .xlsm adding 1st module Macro "Hello World" in text box on screen.  Also added code to call DQAnalysis sheet active and call oufor i from 2 to 3013.  Created title and column headders using 2 methods. 
## 2nd Commit - uploaded green_stocks-Module 2-Rev1.xlsm File Also added code to call DQAnalysis sheet active and call out title and column headders using 2 methods.  First used Range function = "DAQO (Ticker: DQ)".  Second Cells(1, 1).Value = "DAQO(Ticker: DQ)".  
## 3rd commit - begins data analysis using sheet for 2018.  Initial code pulls the column titles from worksheet "2018".  Next a For loop is created to cenerate the total volume of transactions when the stock is DQ.  Used 2 different method for defining the rows for analysis.  First hard coded rows 2 to 2013 from sheet 2018 which limits analysis going forward.  Second method still hard coded but used variables rowstart and rowEnd with set values providing limited flexibility but data additions require updates to that script.  Finally a flexible method was used using range and end calls where it will automatically update and include newest rows of data as only the starting point value (2 - for row 2 where data starts is coded) and this was demonstrated pulling data from sheet 2017. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106294465/172052102-27aeeac1-1f9e-4362-863b-3a8e4d80e5b6.png) Finally, the total volume of transactions for stock DQ were calculated for both sheets 2018 and 2017 and loaded into DQAnalysis sheet.  This was done using a For statement. Within the iteration Transaction_Total_Volume was declared a starting value of 0.  then each cell is checked for DQ (If Cells(i, 1).Value = "DQ" Then)  and if DQ the valued is added Transaction_Total_Volume = Transaction_Total_Volume + Cells(i, 8).Value the IF statement is then ended and the next iteration is repeated.  Once complete, analysis was conducede on sheet 2017 as well and dropped into the DQAnalysis sheet.  Critical learning  was when creating a message box to initially check the value, it was loaded into the iterative loop which made the message box open for each row.  This made the box     pop for every row.  Had to kill excel in order to stop the process and edit code to move out of the loop
## 4th Commit - adds analysis for calculating return on the stock DQ.  This added 2 new variables startingprice and endingprice that were declared as double since the values were not integers and a calcultion is being completed that may result in a fractional result.  These variable are then used to calculate a return on a stock.  This follows in the loops used for the  total transaction volume to iclude the new calculation:  Cells(4, 3).Value = (endingprice / startingprice) - 1.  In the iterative loop starting price  and ending price are compared to the rows above and below the row that is currently being calculated. It is also refined to be looking at only DQ stock.  Analysis is repeated in a second loop for year 2017 as well. The comparison code is shown: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106294465/172054975-f6f118c1-47a9-4cfa-8a11-f38728ba10e3.png).  In the end, the spreed sheet now appears as below: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106294465/172055351-4cdf9e94-3429-467e-997d-9a246322e1ed.png)
